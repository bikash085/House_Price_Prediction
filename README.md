# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices using the dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other factors influencing house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle. It includes:
- Multiple numerical and categorical features.
- Target variable: `SalePrice` (house price in USD).
- Missing values and categorical data that require preprocessing.

## Project Workflow
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Perform feature selection and engineering.
4. Train machine learning models including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
5. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (RMSE, R2 Score).
6. Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
7. Visualize results and key insights.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm
```

## Usage
To train and test the model, run:
```sh
python house_price_prediction.py
```

## Results
The best-performing model achieves high accuracy and low error rates. Feature importance analysis helps in understanding which factors most influence house prices.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models such as neural networks.
- Include external data sources for improved predictions.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
